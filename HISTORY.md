Alpha10. Review feedback from alpha
April 2017

The following feedback was received about the government service register during alpha.

It was suggested that the human readable name for each service should be included in the register, rather than just the domain name. However, a decision was made to not include these because they are outside the control of the custodian. The Government department who the domain is delegated to controls the service name as it is displayed in their content.

There was also feedback requesting that the URL for each government service be included in the register. A decision has been made not to include these because the service domain URL is often different to the start page for that service, and the user journey should begin on the service start page rather than the service domain URL.

Start and end dates have not been included for each service. There was a request for these to be added, however the custodian does not know when a department stops using a service domain and therefore cannot add end dates. A department can choose to retire a service without informing GDS and when a service is retired the domain is often retained to allow for redirects.

No changes were made to the register based on the feedback received.
Alpha9. Meet technical standards
April 2017

The government service register meets the technical standards as it’s hosted by GDS on the open register platform.
Alpha8. Meet operational standards
April 2017

The government service register meets the operational standards as it’s hosted by GDS on the open register platform.
Alpha7. Review how register is updated
April 2017

When a new government service domain is delegated to the team who own the service the custodian will add the new government service to the register.
Alpha6. Find duplicate lists
March 2017

Several internal lists were reviewed and compared, including the list to track new domains and the list generated by the GDS infrastructure team. The output of these was analysed and used to create the government service register.
Discovery5. Review how feedback is collected
March 2017

An email link will be added to each page of the government-service register to allow users to provide feedback. All feedback on the register product will be reviewed by GDS. All feedback about the government-service data will be reviewed by the custodian.
Discovery4. Agree dataset
March 2017

Thomas and the Register Design Authority agreed to include the following fields in the register:

    Government-service (the unique code assigned to the service)
    Hostname (the section of the service domain that identifies a service)
    Government-organisation (the code representing a department, agency or team within government which allows links to the government-organisation register)
    Start-date (currently blank but can be used to denote when a new service started)
    End-date (currently blank but can be used to denote when a service is decommissioned)

A government service will only be added to the register once a government service domain has been created, and the domain has been delegated to the relevant government organisation.
Discovery3. Agree a custodian
February 2017

Tom Moore, GOV.UK Policy and Engagement Manager, was confirmed as the custodian of the government service domain register.

It was agreed that the register will list all government services that have a service.gov.uk domain as this is the list that Tom maintains.

Government service register was approved by Paul Downey at GDS.
